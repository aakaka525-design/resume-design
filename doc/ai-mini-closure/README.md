# AI Mini Closure (Round 2/3 Extension)

## Goal
- Build a minimal, repository-verifiable AI delivery closure package:
1. Requirement definition
2. Worklog trace
3. Code review gate
4. API/contract notes
5. Test record

## Why this exists
- This package is used as **G-1 evidence** (independent AI workflow closure).
- It does not claim production deployment or business impact.

## Boundary
- Scripts and draft content may be generated by AI.
- Human responsibilities in this repo:
1. Define constraints.
2. Review risks.
3. Execute verification commands.
4. Keep immutable records.
