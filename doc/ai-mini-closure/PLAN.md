# Plan

Date: 2026-02-23

## Scope
1. Create one standalone payment idempotency simulation in backend examples.
2. Use TDD evidence (one expected failure, one final pass).
3. Build an AI-delivery documentation pack for traceability.
4. Update capability assessment with conservative claims only.

## Acceptance
1. `pytest` shows initial failure and final pass for idempotency tests.
2. Documentation pack contains `PLAN.md`, `WORKLOG.md`, `CODE-REVIEW.md`, `API.md`, `TEST-REPORT.md`.
3. Capability statements include non-claims and confidence level.
